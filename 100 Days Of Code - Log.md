*Today's Progress*: Build a simple ML Project about Classifying male-female by height weight and shoesize.

*Thoughts*: This is my first project on using sklearn to predict gender. The data include 11 people with their heights, weights and shoe size. There are 5 classifiers that I used for this project: Decision Tree, Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine. Apart from Logistic Regression, All 4 Classifier gave me the exact result which is 'Male'.
