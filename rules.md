## The main promise
I will code for ML at least 1 hour daily for the next 100 days

### Start date
Janyary 11, 2019

### Additional rules
1. I will tweet my daily progress - using the # 100DaysOfCode hashtag
2. If I code in the workplace, that time will not be counted in this challenge.
3. I'll push the code every day in Github so that everyone can see my progress.
4. I will update every day to Dailylip and add links, so that everyone can see my progress.
5. I'll work on real projects, try to solve real problems.
